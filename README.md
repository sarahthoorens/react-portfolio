  ## Description
   This project was created to showcase my skills as a developer. It is a professional portfolio that includes my contact information, a brief bio, a portfolio snippets and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. It also includes a contact section where users can submit messages. 
   
   The program utilizes conditional rendering within React to populate linked pages. <br>

## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

  ## Challenges
 This was one of the most challenging projects for me as a new developer. Handling so many routes, views and models at once proved to be a rather steep learning curve. I originally approached the project with the idea of creating each componenent of the MVC paradigm separately and linking later. This was not a winning approach. I quickly realized that the better approach was to complete an entire view from front to back end and then iterate until all views were complete. 

 I'm quite satisfied with the end product, which is something I never would have dreamed of creating when I was an avid blogger earlier in life. I would like to return to this app to make it more intuitive for the user and give it a sharper look.
